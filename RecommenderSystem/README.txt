PURPOSE:

	To Implement a Recommender System.

PERCENT COMPLETE:

	The assignment is 100% complete.


BUGS:

	No bugs in the file.


FILES:

	This Assignment includes following folders and files:
	tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem.zip
		
	-- tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem
     	--- README.txt
     	--- output.txt : Contains the output generated by my Recommendation System.
     		--- RecommenderSystem
	        	1. Driver.java : This file is used to call all the necessary functions which are required to execute a Recommendation System
				2. FileProcessor.java : This class is used to Read and Write the data needed by the Recommendation System.					3. CalculateAverage.java : This class is used to calculate the average rating of all the users.
				4. Display.java : This class is used to Display the output of the recommendation system.
				5. Prediction.java : This class is used to Generate prediction based on user rating and the item similarities.
				6. Similarities_Generation.java : This class is used to Generate Similarities based on user rating.
				7. makefile: Used to compile all files.
				8. train_all_txt.txt : the inputfile	


TO COMPILE:
	
	Unzip the tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem.zip file. and go the tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem folder.
	1. unzip tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem.zip
	2. cd tkale1_Project_RecommenderSystem
	3. cd RecommenderSystem

	Now use the make file to compile all the files. Use the following command :
		tanmaykale$ make
			javac CalculateAverage.java
			javac Display.java
			javac Driver.java

TO RUN:
		The driver code takes 4 arguments:
			1. Name of the input file : train_all_txt.txt
			2. Total no Users : 943 	(the value of m)
			3. Total no Items : 1682	(the value of n)
			4.  Name of the output file : output.txt

			use the below command (if the inputfile is outside the RecommenderSystem folder):
				java Driver ./train_all_txt.txt 943 1682 output.txt

			use the below command (if the inputfile is inside the RecommenderSystem folder):
				java Driver train_all_txt.txt 943 1682 output.txt

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
		Tanmays-MacBook-Pro:RecommenderSystem tanmaykale$ java Driver ./train_all_txt.txt 943 1682 output.txt
		
		./train_all_txt.txt file successfully opened for reading
		Reading Data from file to process.
		Generating Average of User Ratings.
		Generating Item Based Similarities.
		Making prediction based on Similarities.
		Writing Data to the output file.

		Output created...
